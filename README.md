This is a project in which i have used Google APIs to design a simple ETL to extract comments from any Youtube Video data to get some actionable insights.

There's 2 Python Notebook files in this repo

1. scrapping_youtube_comments.ipynb is a code file which can be used to scrap all comments from any youtube video

2. scrap_comments_and_replies_from_youtube_playlist.ipynb is a code file which has functions and google api calls which can be used to fetch comments and replies from all youtube videos within a playlist.
